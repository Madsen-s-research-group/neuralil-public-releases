# Code used to calculate the roots of the spherical Bessel functions of the
# first kind. Inspired on the C implementation by Jeremy K. Mason, also under
# an Apache license and included as part of the reference implementation of
# the spherical Bessel descriptors (doi: 10.1063/1.5111045 ,
# https://github.com/harharkh/sb_desc ). However, here we use the scipy root
# finding routines.

# The calculation starts with the roots of the order-0 function and
# proceeds upwards. Therefore, caching is essential.


class SphericalBesselRoots:
    """Calculator and cache of the roots of spherical Bessel functions.

    Access to the roots is supposed to happen directly through the "table"
    attribute. The first index is the order of the function, and the second
    is the order of the root. A negative value means that the corresponding
    root has not been calculated.

    Args:
        n_max: The maximum value of n to be used when generating the spherical
            Bessel descriptors. This affects which roots are calculated.
        dtype: The floating-point type to be used for the calculations.

    Raises:
        ValueError if n_max is negative.
